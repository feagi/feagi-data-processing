//! Trait definition for types that can be serialized to and from FEAGI bytes structures.

use crate::FeagiDataError;
use super::{FeagiByteStructure, FeagiByteStructureType};

/// Trait for types that can be serialized to and deserialized from FEAGI bytes structures.
///
/// This trait enables seamless conversion between Rust types and the FEAGI binary format,
/// providing both serialization (to bytes) and deserialization (from bytes) capabilities.
/// Types implementing this trait can participate in FEAGI's standardized data exchange
/// protocols.
///
/// # Core Capabilities
///
/// - **Type Identity**: Each implementation declares its format type and version
/// - **Serialization**: Convert Rust objects to FEAGI bytes format
/// - **Deserialization**: Create Rust objects from FEAGI bytes format
/// - **Size Estimation**: Calculate required buffer sizes for efficient allocation
/// - **Validation**: Ensure sufficient buffer space before serialization
///
/// # Serialization Format
///
/// All compatible types must follow the FEAGI bytes structure format:
/// ```text
/// [Type ID (1 bytes)][Version (1 bytes)][Type-specific payload...]
/// ```
///
/// # Implementation Requirements
///
/// Implementors must provide:
/// - Format type and version identification
/// - Serialization logic that writes to a provided bytes slice
/// - Deserialization logic that reconstructs objects from bytes structures
/// - Accurate size estimation for buffer allocation
/// 
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// Implementations should be thread-safe, as bytes structures may be
/// processed concurrently in multi-threaded FEAGI environments.
pub trait FeagiByteStructureCompatible {

    /// Returns the FEAGI bytes structure type identifier for this implementation.
    ///
    /// This identifier is used as the first bytes in the serialized format to
    /// indicate what type of data structure is contained in the bytes stream.
    fn get_type(&self) -> FeagiByteStructureType;

    /// Returns the version number for this implementation's serialization format.
    ///
    /// Version numbers allow for format evolution while maintaining backward
    /// compatibility. This value is stored as the second bytes in the serialized format.

    /// Serializes this object into the provided bytes slice.
    ///
    /// Writes the complete FEAGI bytes structure representation (including header)
    /// into the provided mutable slice. The implementation should write the type
    /// identifier, version, and all object data.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `slice` - Mutable bytes slice to write into (must have sufficient capacity)
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// * `Ok(usize)` - Number of bytes actually written to the slice
    /// * `Err(FeagiDataError)` - If serialization fails or slice is too small
    ///
    /// # Requirements
    /// - Must call `verify_slice_has_enough_space()` before writing
    /// - Must write exactly the format specified by `get_type()` and `get_version()`
    /// - Should write deterministic output for the same object state

    /// including the 2-bytes header (type + version) plus all object data.
    /// Used for efficient buffer allocation.

    /// Maximum bytes count needed for complete serialization (including header)

    ///
    /// Deserializes a complete object from the provided bytes structure,
    /// validating the format and reconstructing the original object state.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `feagi_byte_structure` - Source bytes structure containing serialized data
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// * `Ok(Self)` - Successfully deserialized object
    /// * `Err(FeagiDataError)` - If deserialization fails due to:
    ///   - Invalid format or corrupted data
    ///   - Type/version mismatch
    ///   - Insufficient data in the bytes structure
    ///

    ///
    /// This helper method checks if the provided slice can accommodate the
    /// complete serialized representation of this object. Should be called
    /// before attempting serialization.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `slice` - Byte slice to validate for sufficient capacity
